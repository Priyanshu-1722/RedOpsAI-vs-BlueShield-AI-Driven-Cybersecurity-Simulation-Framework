# üî¥ RedOpsAI vs BlueShield

## üß† Description
**RedOpsAI vs BlueShield** is an AI-powered **Red Team vs Blue Team simulation framework**.  
It automates offensive security operations, defensive monitoring, and adaptive learning using:

- **AI-driven attack orchestration**
- **Snort-based intrusion detection**
- **Zero Trust firewall enforcement**
- **Real-time ELK Stack analysis**
- **Feedback-based SIEM learning**

The framework simulates **realistic adversarial scenarios**, enabling cybersecurity teams to train, test, and evolve their detection and response strategies.

## üîÅ Workflow Summary
1. **PC1 (RedOps AI Controller)** ‚Äî Orchestrates attacks using AI, parses logs, and adapts attack strategies.
2. **PC2 (Attack Engine)** ‚Äî Executes real-world attacks from Kali with tools like Metasploit, Hydra, and OpenVAS.
3. **pfSense Firewall** ‚Äî Controls and monitors traffic between Red and Blue teams, optionally running Suricata IDS.
4. **PC3 (BlueShield Monitor)** ‚Äî Detects, analyzes, and correlates attack patterns in real-time using SIEM tools.
5. **PC4 (Web Server)** ‚Äî The live target for testing, protected by BlueShield monitoring and Zero Trust rules.

If you want, I can also make a **graphical network diagram** for this architecture so your GitHub README looks visually striking rather than just text-based ASCII. That would make the project page pop.
