# 🔴 RedOpsAI vs BlueShield

## 🧠 Project Overview
**RedOpsAI vs BlueShield** is an **AI-powered Red Team vs Blue Team cybersecurity simulation framework**.  
It allows researchers, SOC analysts, and security engineers to **simulate realistic cyberattacks** and **observe, detect, and respond** to them in real time.

The setup combines **offensive security (RedOps AI)** and **defensive monitoring (BlueShield)** with a **Zero Trust architecture** and **feedback-driven adaptive learning**.  
It is designed for **training, research, and automated security testing**.

---

## 📌 What the Project Is
- A **multi-system simulation environment** replicating real-world adversarial cybersecurity scenarios.
- AI controls the Red Team (attacker) to launch targeted attacks against a simulated network.
- Blue Team (defender) detects and mitigates threats using **SIEM, IDS/IPS, and ELK Stack dashboards**.
- Features **automated attack orchestration** and **machine learning-based defense feedback loops**.

---

## 🛠️ What I Did
- **Designed and built** a 4-system network environment using virtual machines, pfSense, and security tools.
- Integrated **AI models** to dynamically adjust attack patterns based on detection feedback.
- Configured **Kali Linux attack tools** (Metasploit, Hydra, nmap, sqlmap, etc.).
- Deployed **Blue Team stack** (Snort, Wazuh, Suricata, ELK Stack) for live detection and log correlation.
- Established **Zero Trust network segmentation** via pfSense firewall.
- Automated **alerting and reporting** between RedOps AI Controller and BlueShield Monitor.

---

## 🧩 Problems Solved
- **Bridging the gap** between offensive and defensive training — usually, these are taught separately.
- **Reducing manual effort** in cybersecurity simulations by automating attack orchestration.
- **Providing real attack data** for improving IDS/IPS rules and SOC workflows.
- **Creating a feedback-based SIEM learning loop** for continuously adapting to evolving threats.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Offensive Security Tools**: nmap, sqlmap, hydra, metasploit, nikto, gobuster, OpenVAS
- **Defensive Security Tools**: Snort, Suricata, OSSEC/Wazuh, ELK Stack, Nagios
- **Networking & Security**: pfSense, OpenVPN, OpenSSL/XCA
- **Programming & Automation**: Python 3, Bash scripting, LM Studio AI integration
- **Platforms**: Kali Linux, Ubuntu Server, Windows Server (optional for PC4)
- **Monitoring & Analysis**: Kibana dashboards, log correlation, automated alerting

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **design secure segmented network topologies** for attack/defense testing.
- Practical **integration of AI models** with security workflows.
- Advanced **SIEM log parsing and correlation techniques**.
- **Tuning IDS/IPS rules** to improve detection while reducing false positives.
- Coordinating **Red Team and Blue Team strategies** in a controlled lab setup.

## ⚙️ Working & Implementation
### Workflow Summary
1. **PC1 (RedOps AI Controller)** — Orchestrates and adjusts attacks based on Blue Team feedback.
2. **PC2 (Attack Engine)** — Executes attacks from Kali Linux against the network.
3. **pfSense Firewall** — Implements Zero Trust rules and controls all traffic.
4. **PC3 (BlueShield Monitor)** — Detects intrusions, analyzes logs, and issues alerts.
5. **PC4 (Web Server)** — Hosts the protected target application for attack simulations.

### Data Flow
- Attack traffic flows from PC2 → pfSense → PC4.
- All logs and events from PC4 and pfSense are sent to PC3.
- PC3’s SIEM and IDS analyze the data and alert PC1.
- PC1 adjusts attack strategies based on detection patterns.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Cloud Integration** — Deploy the simulation on AWS/Azure/GCP for distributed training.
- **Enhanced AI Models** — Use reinforcement learning for adaptive attack/defense strategies.
- **Gamification** — Implement scoring systems for training cybersecurity teams.
- **Integration with SOAR** — Automate incident response beyond detection.
- **More Attack Vectors** — Add IoT device exploitation and ransomware simulations.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
The **RedOpsAI vs BlueShield** framework demonstrates the **power of AI in cybersecurity simulations**.  
It creates a **realistic, controlled environment** where offensive and defensive techniques can be tested, improved, and automated.  
By combining **AI orchestration, Zero Trust architecture, and real-time monitoring**, the project enables **continuous security improvement** and **real-world SOC training**.

If you want, I can **replace the ASCII diagram with a clean, colorful vector-style network diagram** so it looks like a professional cyber range architecture map instead of plain text. That would make your GitHub README stand out a lot more visually.
